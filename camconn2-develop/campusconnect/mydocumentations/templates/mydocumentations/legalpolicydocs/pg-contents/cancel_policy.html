Please read carefully the terms and conditions of our Cancellation and Refund Policy.

<ul class="text-reset">   
<li>
You can cancel an order only if you purchase item(s) as a registered customer.
</li>
<li>
Every order has a grace period after purchase. You cannot cancel an order after 
the grace period is over because once a grace period is over, we start processing 
your order.
</li>

<li>
If you want to cancel an order, you need to login your resumenalyzer 
account Dashboard, and need to go to 'My Orders', and then cancel from there.
</li>

<li>
We will send you confirmation email after you request for a cancellation. 
</li>

<li>
Since we use the third party transaction service 'Paypal' as our payment gateway, 
when you request for a refund, the request is directed to Paypal for processing the 
transaction. Paypal takes them 7 to 10 business days receiving any request and thereby that 
time will be taken to process the refund.
</li>

<li>
If you contact us before Paypal's response period of 10 days aforementioned, 
we might not be able to provide you with any proper reply on the refund status. 
Once Paypal has made the transaction and confirmed with us, we will let you know 
promptly via email.
</li>

</p>

<p>
We will check your claim and grant/deny refund requests based on your particular case.
